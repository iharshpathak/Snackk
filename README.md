###  Note:
This application is hosted on Render's free-tier service. As a result, the backend server may enter a sleep state after 15 minutes of inactivity. If the app appears unresponsive, please allow 2–5 minutes and try refreshing the page. The server should wake up and resume normal functionality shortly. Thank you for your patience! 🙏
